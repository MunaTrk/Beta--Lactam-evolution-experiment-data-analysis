This repository contains the analysis code and main results for the master thesis titled "Tradeoff-Induced Fitness Landscapes with Diminishing Returns Epistasis" by Muna Turki at the University of Cologne.
The Data were obtained from the preprint "Fitness seascapes facilitate the prediction of therapy resistance under time-varying selection" by King et el. 
The Code file has to be saved in the same directory with the Data File, upon installation of the libraries needed the code should produce all results running the code cells from top to bottem.
